## Public Members

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| static [CopyFromTemplate](KestrelOptionsExtensions/CopyFromTemplate)(…) | Shallow-copies every writable property from *src* to *dest*, then deep-copies the nested KestrelServerLimits. A small “skip” list prevents us from overwriting framework internals. |
