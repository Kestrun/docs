# ClaimRule constructor

Represents one “claim must equal …” rule.

```csharp
public ClaimRule(string ClaimType, params string[] AllowedValues)
```

## Remarks

This is used to define authorization policies that require a specific claim type with specific allowed values. It is typically used in conjunction with [`ClaimPolicyConfig`](../ClaimPolicyConfig.md) to define multiple policies.
