# SchedulerService constructor

Represents a service for managing scheduled tasks. Provides methods to schedule, cancel, pause, resume, and report on tasks. This service is designed to run within a Kestrun application context. It supports both C# and PowerShell jobs, allowing for flexible scheduling options.

```csharp
public SchedulerService(KestrunRunspacePoolManager pool, ILogger log, TimeZoneInfo? tz = null)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| pool | The runspace pool manager for executing PowerShell scripts. |
| log | The logger instance for logging events. |
| tz | The optional time zone information. |

## Remarks

The service uses a runspace pool for PowerShell jobs and supports scheduling via cron expressions or intervals. It also provides methods to retrieve task reports in various formats, including typed objects and PowerShell-friendly hashtables.

Initializes a new instance of the [`SchedulerService`](../SchedulerService) class. This constructor sets up the scheduler service with a specified runspace pool, logger, and optional time zone. The runspace pool is used for executing PowerShell scripts, while the logger is used for logging events.
