    bool IsCompleted = false)
```

| parameter | description |

| Name | The name of the scheduled task. |
| LastRunAt | The last time the task was run. |
| NextRunAt | The next scheduled run time for the task. |
| IsSuspended | Indicates whether the task is currently suspended. |
| IsCompleted | Indicates whether the scheduling loop has exited (task fully cancelled). |
