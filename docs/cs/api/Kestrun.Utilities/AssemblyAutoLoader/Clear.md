# AssemblyAutoLoader.Clear method

Detaches the `AssemblyResolve` hook and, optionally, clears the list of search-directories. Call this at the end of a runspace or when the application no longer needs dynamic resolution.

```csharp
public static void Clear(bool clearSearchDirs = false)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| clearSearchDirs | `true` ⇒ also forget the registered folders. Leave it `false` if you want to keep the list so a later `PreloadAll()` call can reuse it without re-scanning. |
