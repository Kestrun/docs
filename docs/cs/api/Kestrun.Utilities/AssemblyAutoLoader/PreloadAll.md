# AssemblyAutoLoader.PreloadAll method

Scans the supplied directories, loads every DLL that isn’t already loaded, and installs an `AssemblyResolve` hook so that any later requests are resolved automatically.

```csharp
public static void PreloadAll(bool verbose = false, params string[] directories)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| verbose | If `true`, outputs diagnostic information to the console. |
| directories | One or more absolute paths (they may be repeated; duplicates ignored). |

## Remarks

You can call this more than once — new folders are merged into the internal set, previously scanned ones are skipped.
