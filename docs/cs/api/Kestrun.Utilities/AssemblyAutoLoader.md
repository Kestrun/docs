# AssemblyAutoLoader class

Registers one or more folders that contain private assemblies and makes sure every DLL in those folders is available to PowerShell / scripts. Call [`PreloadAll`](./AssemblyAutoLoader/PreloadAll) **once** at startup (or from PowerShell) and forget about “could not load assembly …” errors.

```csharp
public static class AssemblyAutoLoader
```

## Public Members

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| static [Clear](AssemblyAutoLoader/Clear)(…) | Detaches the `AssemblyResolve` hook and, optionally, clears the list of search-directories. Call this at the end of a runspace or when the application no longer needs dynamic resolution. |
| static [PreloadAll](AssemblyAutoLoader/PreloadAll)(…) | Scans the supplied directories, loads every DLL that isn’t already loaded, and installs an `AssemblyResolve` hook so that any later requests are resolved automatically. |
